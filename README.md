# Transaction

Transaction is a small library which helps track status of running/upcoming tasks. These tasks can be a cron job, background jobs or a simple method. Any task can be plugged into a transaction block. Transaction uses redis to store the current status along with the additional attributes(provided during the initialization or transaction updation.)

To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'transaction'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install transaction

## Usage

### Initializing a transaction
A transaction can be newly initialized or be found with the given transaction_id. If no transaction is found then a new transaction in created.
```ruby
  attributes = {created_at: Time.now, count: 0 }
  transaction = Transaction::Client.new(options: attributes) # creates a new instance of transaction
  transaction1 = Transaction::Client.new(transaction_id: transaction.id) # finds the transaction.
```

### Accepted methods for a transaction
The default status of any new transaction is **`queued`**.
Accepted statuses: **['queued', 'processing', 'success', 'error']**. Any transaction at any point will be in one of the states.

method | params | description      
|:-:|---|---
start!  | - | moves to status `processing` from `queued`.
finish! | (status='success', clear=false) | moves to the passed status (default: `success`). `clear = true` destroys the entry from redis cache.
clear!  | - | destroys the current entry from redis cache.
refresh! | - | sync current instance transaction with latest cache (Other instance of transaction initiated with same transaction id can update the attributes. Hence `refresh!` is required.).
update_status | status | moves to the passed status. Raises `'Invalid Status'` error if status is not in one of the **Accepted statuses** defined above.
update_attributes | options = {} | merges the passed options hash to the current attributes object.


### Ex 1: Simple transaction
```ruby
    def sum_numbers
      arr = (0...10_000).to_a
      options = { created_at: Time.now, total: arr.count  }
      transaction = Transaction::Client.new(options: options)

      transaction.start!
      puts transaction.status # Status moves from `queued` to `processing`

      count = 0
      (1..10_000).each do |i|
        # do some other stuff
        transaction.update_attributes(count: count += 1)
        # do some other stuff
      end

      transaction.finish! # By default moves to status 'success'.

      puts transaction.status # 'success'
      puts transaction.attributes # {:status=>:success, :created_at=>2019-07-19 06:06:43 +0530, :total=>10000, :count=>10000}
    end
```

### Ex 2: Initialize or find a transaction with a transaction id.
```ruby
    def task1
      transaction = Transaction::Client.new
      SomeWorkerJob.perform_later(transaction.transaction_id) # sidekiq or resque
    end

    class SomeWorkerJob < ApplicationJob
      queue_as :default

      def perform transaction_id
        tr = Transaction::Client.new(transaction_id: transaction_id) # intialize with given transaction_id
        tr.start!

        # do a bunch of stuff
        tr.finish!
      end
    end
```

### Keeping transactions in sync.
Let's say we have 2 transactions `t1` and `t2` both initialized with same transaction id. If `t2` updates the transaction, then `t1` can simple refresh the transaction to get in sync with `t2`. Note: the transaction will be refreshed with the most recent values. (Versioning transaction updates ??? => Woah that's a nice PR idea.)
```ruby
  def task1
    transaction = Transaction::Client.new
    transaction.start!
    task2(transaction.transaction_id)
    sleep(5) # just letting task 2 finish.

    puts transaction.status # 'processing'
    transaction.refresh!
    puts transaction.status # 'error'
  end

  def task2 transaction_id # in some other context altogether. Task 2 is not at all related to task 1.
    transaction = Transaction::Client.new(transaction_id: transaction_id)
    # do some stuff
    transaction.finish!('error')
  end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
